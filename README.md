#Graph-based Indonesian Named Entity Recognition (GInNER)
This model is used to predict a named entity in Indonesian text utilizing a graph representation technique, graph convolutional network (GCN). 
The model is built by modifying an existing GCN-NER by A. Cetoli, S. Bragaglia, A.D. O'Harney, M. Sloan (https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10053).
